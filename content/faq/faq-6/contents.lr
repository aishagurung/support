### Number of Tor users
We estimate the number of users by analyzing the requests induced by clients to relays and bridges. 
As of Nov 23 2020, the highest number of estimated number of directly-connecting clients (it excludes clients connecting via bridges) on any given day stands at approximately 2.85 million users and the highest number of estimated number of clients connecting via bridges on any given day stands at approximately 189,318 users. These statistics can be found by looking at the data and graphs available on the Tor metrics portal about the estimated number of [relay users](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html) and the [bridge users](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-country.html) worldwide. The numbers stated for both bridge and relay users are the average number of concurrent users estimated from data collected over a day. We can't say how many distinct users there are.
The Oxford Internet Institute made a cartogram visualization of Tor users as compared to the overall Internet population. According to their [findings](http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/the-anonymous-internet/) published on June 9th, 2014 Tor is used world-wide by over 750,000 Internet users every day. 
### Number of exit nodes
The number of exit nodes can be found from the [network bubble graphs in the "exits only" category](https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html#no-group-exits-only). We estimate the number by using a value derived from a relay's consensus weight that resembles the probability of selecting that relay as exit node. Currently the number of relays used as exit nodes is 1384 out of which 1293 are visible.
